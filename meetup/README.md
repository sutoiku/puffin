# Meetup

PuffinDB will hold a kickoff meeting for sponsors and committers in March 2023, at the [Grand Park Hotel](https://www.maistra.com/properties/grand-park-hotel-rovinj/#/) in Rovinj, Croatia. This event will take place over 3 days. Participants pay for travels expenses, while PuffinDB provides accomodations free of charge. The goal of the event is to finalize the architecture for PuffinDB, including [Icecap](../docs/Icecap.md). And to have a bit of fun while doing it...
